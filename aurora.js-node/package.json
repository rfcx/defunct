  "readme": "Aurora.js\n=========\n\nAurora.js is a framework that makes writing audio decoders in JavaScript easier.  It handles common \ntasks for you such as dealing with binary data, and the decoding pipeline from source to demuxer to \ndecoder, and finally to the audio hardware itself by abstracting browser audio APIs.  Aurora contains \ntwo high level APIs for inspecting and playing back decoded audio, and it is easily extendible to support \nmore sources, demuxers, decoders, and audio devices.\n\nCheck out the [documentation](https://github.com/ofmlabs/aurora.js/wiki) to learn more about using and \nextending Aurora.\n\n## Demo\n\nWe have written several decoders using Aurora.js, whose demos you can find [here](http://labs.official.fm/codecs/)\nand whose source code can be found on our [Github](https://github.com/ofmlabs) page.\n\n## Authors\n\nAurora.js was written by [@jensnockert](https://github.com/jensnockert) and [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett) \nof [@ofmlabs](https://github.com/ofmlabs).\n\n## Building\n\nCurrently, the [importer](https://github.com/devongovett/importer) module is used to build Aurora.js.  You can run\nthe development server by first installing `importer` with npm, and then running it like this:\n\n    sudo npm install importer -g\n    importer src/aurora.coffee -p 8080\n    \nYou can also build a static version like this:\n\n    importer src/aurora.coffee aurora.js\n    \nBy itself, Aurora will play LPCM, uLaw and aLaw files in a number of containers.  Be sure to add additional codec support \nby including some of our other decoders such as [FLAC.js](https://github.com/ofmlabs/flac.js), \n[ALAC.js](https://github.com/ofmlabs/alac.js), and [MP3.js](https://github.com/devongovett/mp3.js).\n\n## License\n\nAurora.js is released under the MIT license.",
